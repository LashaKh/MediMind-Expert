      content: '**Evidence Level B**: As per ACC/AHA/AMSSM/…/SCMR 2024 guidelines: \n- Obtain a comprehensive, systematic noninvasive SCD risk assessment at initial evaluation and every 1-2 years thereafter, including evaluation of the following risk factors, in pediatric and adolescent patients with HCM: personal history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmia; personal history of syncope suspected by clinical history to be arrhythmic; family history in a close relative of premature HCM-related sudden death, cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular arrhythmia; maximal LV wall thickness, ejection fraction, LV apical aneurysm; nonsustained VT episodes on continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring\n- Obtain repeat TTE every 1-2 years to assess the degree of myocardial hypertrophy, dynamic LVOTO, MR, and myocardial function in patients with HCM having no change in clinical status or events.\n- Consider obtaining cardiac MRI to assess for the extent of myocardial fibrosis with late gadolinium enhancement in pediatric and adolescent patients with HCM having a borderline risk for SCD, or if a decision to proceed with ICD implantation remains uncertain after a clinical assessment that includes personal and family history, echocardiography, and ambulatory ECG monitoring.\n- Initiate antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, mexiletine, sotalol) in pediatric patients with HCM and recurrent ventricular arrhythmias despite β-blocker use. Decide on the choice of agent based on age, underlying comorbidities, severity of disease, patient preferences, and balance between efficacy and safety.\n\n**Evidence Level C**: \n- Consider calculating an estimated 5-year sudden death risk, including echocardiographic parameters (interventricular septal thickness in diastole, LV posterior wall thickness in end-diastole, LA diameter, maximal LVOT gradient) and genotype, to be used for shared decision-making for ICD implantation in patients aged < 16 years with HCM.\n- Consider performing ICD implantation in pediatric patients with HCM having ≥ 1 conventional risk factors, including unexplained syncope, massive LVH, nonsustained VT, or family history of early HCM-related SCD, after considering the relatively high complication rates of long-term ICD implantation in younger patients.\n- Consider taking into account additional factors, such as extensive late gadolinium enhancement on contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI and systolic dysfunction, in risk stratification for ICD shared decision-making in pediatric patients with HCM.'
