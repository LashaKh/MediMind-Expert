      title: 'Definition',
      content: 'HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by LVH and a non-dilated left ventricle with preserved or increased ejection fraction. ¹'
    },
    pathophysiology: {
      title: 'Pathophysiology',
      content: 'HCM is most frequently caused by genetic mutations in genes (β-myosin heavy chain [MYH7] and myosin binding protein C [MYBPC3]) encoding sarcomere proteins. LVH leads to diastolic dysfunction, reduced systolic output volume, decreased peripheral and myocardial perfusion, cardiac arrhythmia and/or HF and finally increased risk of SCD. ¹'
    },
    epidemiology: {
      title: 'Epidemiology',
      content: 'The prevalence of HCM in the US is low, with an estimated 200 cases per 100,000 population. HCM incidence is bimodal (peak incidence in the second decade and third decade of life). ²'
    },
    diseaseCourse: {
      title: 'Disease Course',
      content: 'Clinical manifestations include symptoms due to increased LV end-diastolic pressure (exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, orthopnea, peripheral edema, and HFpEF), LV outflow obstruction (exertional or immediately post-exertional syncope, ventricular arrhythmia), chest pain, palpitations, VT. Disease progression may lead to AF, hypertension, valvular disease, HF, and SCD. ¹'

    prognosisAndRiskOfRecurrence: {
      title: 'Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence',
      content: 'HCM is associated with an annual mortality rate of 0.5%, and mortality is higher in children. However, SCD is often the first clinical manifestation. ³'
