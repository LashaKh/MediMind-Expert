      overview: {
        definition: 'Cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy refers to the spectrum of cardiovascular complications that can arise from the use of anticancer treatments, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy. These complications can range from asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction to life-threatening cardiovascular events.',
        pathophysiology: 'Cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity involves multiple mechanisms depending on the specific treatment modality. Anthracyclines cause direct myocardial injury through oxidative stress and DNA damage. Targeted therapies like HER2 inhibitors disrupt essential cardiac signaling pathways. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can trigger autoimmune myocarditis. Radiation therapy causes endothelial damage and accelerated atherosclerosis. VEGF inhibitors disrupt vascular homeostasis leading to hypertension and thrombosis.',
        epidemiology: 'The incidence of cardiovascular toxicity varies widely depending on the specific cancer therapy, dosing regimen, patient risk factors, and definition used. Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy occurs in approximately 1-5% of patients. Trastuzumab-associated cardiac dysfunction occurs in 2-7% of patients in clinical trials but may be higher in real-world practice. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis occurs in <1% of patients but carries high mortality.',
        diseaseCourse: 'The temporal course of cardiovascular toxicity varies by treatment type. Acute effects may occur during or immediately after treatment (fluoropyrimidines, immune checkpoint inhibitors). Chronic effects can develop months to years after therapy completion, particularly with anthracyclines and radiation therapy. Some toxicities are reversible with treatment interruption and appropriate cardiac management, while others may result in permanent cardiac dysfunction.',
        prognosis: 'The prognosis of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity depends on multiple factors including the specific treatment, severity of cardiac dysfunction, timing of detection, and implementation of appropriate cardiovascular interventions. Early detection and management can improve outcomes and allow for continuation of life-saving cancer therapy in many cases.'
