**Last Updated:** May 31, 2025

## What's New

The updated American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) provide recommendations for the management of cardiogenic shock in ACS. Emergency revascularization of the culprit lesion by PCI or CABG is recommended regardless of time from symptom onset, but routine PCI of a non-infarct-related artery should not be performed due to an increased risk of renal failure and death. Short-term mechanical circulatory support devices are suggested for hemodynamic stabilization as a bridge to surgery. Based on the DanGer-SHOCK trial, a microaxial intravascular flow pump is now suggested for selected patients with STEMI and severe or refractory cardiogenic shock. Routine use of intra-aortic balloon pump and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is not recommended due to a lack of survival benefit.

**Reference:** [Pierre-Grégoire Guinot et al. Chest. 2025 Apr](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/references-needed)

### Inotropes
As per ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines, administer IV inotropic support to maintain systemic perfusion and preserve end-organ performance in patients with cardiogenic shock. **Evidence Level: B**

### Vasopressors
As per ESC 2021 guidelines, consider administering a vasopressor, preferably norepinephrine, to increase BP and vital organ perfusion in patients with cardiogenic shock. **Evidence Level: C**
