**Last Updated:** May 28, 2025

## What's New

The updated American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) provide recommendations for the management of resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest. Primary PCI is recommended in the presence of evidence of STEMI for noncomatose patients and comatose patients with favorable prognostic features. It is also suggested for selected comatose patients with unfavorable prognostic features. Immediate angiography is not recommended for comatose, electrically and hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of STEMI.

## Background

### Overview

#### Definition
Cardiac arrest is defined as the functional loss of mechanical cardiac activity, leading to cessation of systemic circulation.

#### Pathophysiology
The most common cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is ischemic heart disease, with up to 70% patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest having significant coronary artery disease on coronary angiography. In patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia represent the most common causes. Other causes of cardiac arrest include non-ischemic heart disease, as well as non-cardiac diseases (shock of any etiology, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, drug overdose).

#### Epidemiology
In the US, the incidence of cardiac arrest is estimated at 55 cases per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest is estimated at 1-6 cases per 1,000 hospital admissions.

#### Disease Course
Patients who achieve ROSC after cardiac arrest have a high mortality rate, owing to the development of post-cardiac arrest syndrome, which is characterized by multi-organ dysfunction, including post-cardiac arrest brain injury and post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction.

#### Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence
In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 30-day survival is estimated at 5.8% in patients in whom CPR is not performed, and 13.5-13.8% in patients in whom CPR is performed. In patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, 30-day survival is estimated at 28.3%.

- Consider obtaining multimodal neuroprognostication at a minimum of 72 hours after normothermia in patients remaining comatose after cardiac arrest. **[Evidence Level C]**

#### Clinical Evaluation
As per AHA 2020 guidelines, consider assessing the following at ≥ 72 hours after cardiac arrest, in combination with other prognostic tests, to support the prognosis of poor neurological outcome:
- Bilaterally absent pupillary light reflex
- Bilaterally absent corneal reflexes
- Quantitative pupillometry
- Status myoclonus **[Evidence Level C]**

#### Laboratory Evaluation
As per AHA 2020 guidelines, consider assessing for high serum values of NSE within 72 hours after cardiac arrest, in combination with other prognostic tests, to support the prognosis of poor neurological outcome in patients remaining comatose. **[Evidence Level C]**

#### Electroencephalography
As per AHA 2020 guidelines, consider using the following findings in combination with other prognostic tests to support the prognosis of poor neurological outcome:
- Persistent status epilepticus ≥ 72 hours after cardiac arrest
- Burst suppression on EEG in the absence of sedating medications at ≥ 72 hours after cardiac arrest
- Bilaterally absent N20 somatosensory evoked potential waves > 24 hours after cardiac arrest **[Evidence Level C]**

#### Neuroimaging
As per AHA 2020 guidelines:
- Consider assessing for reduced gray-white ratio on brain CT after cardiac arrest, in combination with other prognostic tests, to support the prognosis of poor neurological outcome. **[Evidence Level C]**
- Consider assessing for extensive areas of restricted diffusion and reduced apparent diffusion coefficient on brain MRI at 2-7 days after cardiac arrest. **[Evidence Level C]**

### Recovery and Survivorship
As per AHA 2020 guidelines:
- Obtain structured assessment for anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and fatigue in cardiac arrest survivors and their caregivers. **[Evidence Level B]**
- Obtain multimodal rehabilitation assessment and offer treatment for physical, neurological, cardiopulmonary and cognitive impairments before discharge from the hospital. **[Evidence Level B]**
- Provide comprehensive, multidisciplinary discharge planning including medical and rehabilitative treatment recommendations. **[Evidence Level B]**

### Post-Cardiac Arrest ICD Implantation

#### Ischemic Heart Disease
As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines, perform ICD placement in patients with ischemic heart disease survived sudden cardiac arrest due to VT/VF, if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year. **[Evidence Level B]**

#### Cardiomyopathies
As per ESC 2022 guidelines, perform ICD placement in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy survived sudden cardiac arrest due to VT/VF or experienced hemodynamically not-tolerated sustained monomorphic VT. **[Evidence Level B]**

As per ACC/AHA 2020 guidelines, perform ICD placement in patients with HCM and previous documented cardiac arrest or sustained VT. **[Evidence Level B]**

#### Brugada Syndrome
As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines, perform ICD in patients with Brugada syndrome with spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern survived cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, or with a recent history of syncope presumed due to ventricular arrhythmia, if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year. **[Evidence Level B]**

#### Idiopathic VT/VF
As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines, perform ICD placement in patients resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest due to idiopathic polymorphic VT or VF, if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year. **[Evidence Level B]**

### Organ Donation
As per AHA 2024 guidelines:
- Consider discussing organ donation in all patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest and meeting neurological criteria for death. **[Evidence Level B]**
- Consider discussing organ donation in all patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest before a planned withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. **[Evidence Level B]**

## Quality Improvement

### Public Access Defibrillation
As per ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Ensure public access defibrillation is available at sites where cardiac arrest is more likely to occur. **[Evidence Level B]**
- Promote community training in basic life support to increase bystander CPR rate and automated external defibrillator use. **[Evidence Level B]**
