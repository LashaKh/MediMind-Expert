## Screening and Diagnosis

### Definition
As per ERS 2021 guidelines, consider viewing patients with symptoms attributable to post-thrombotic deposits within pulmonary arteries as having CTEPD, with or without pulmonary hypertension. Use CTEPH term in patients with pulmonary hypertension. **[Evidence Level: E]**

### Epidemiology
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:

- Recognize that CTEPH is a rare and underdiagnosed complication of PE and upon first presentation may be misclassified as acute PE. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Recognize that persistent perfusion defects after acute PE are common, but have highly variable clinical relevance, ranging from completely asymptomatic to established CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Insufficient evidence to suggest that CTEPD without pulmonary hypertension is an early stage of CTEPH, because of a lack of data on its natural history. **[Evidence Level: I]**
- Insufficient evidence to demonstrate any difference in CTEPH incidence in patients with VTE treated with VKAs and non-VKA OACs. **[Evidence Level: I]**

### Pathophysiology
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:

- Recognize that two types of vascular lesions exist in CTEPH:
  - Proximal fibrotic obstruction in large elastic pulmonary arteries
  - Secondary microvasculopathy in pulmonary vessels < 500 mcm **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Recognize that morphological delineation of pulmonary and bronchial circulation is possible with CTPA, while MRI permits both anatomical visualization and semi-quantitative analysis of the extent of bronchopulmonary shunting, and none of these techniques can quantify the microvasculopathy. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Recognize that the right ventricle is less adapted in CTEPH than in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, but recovers largely after successful pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: E]**

### Indications for Screening
- As per ERS 2021 guidelines, insufficient evidence to recommend screening for CTEPH in asymptomatic patients with specific risk factors. **[Evidence Level: I]**
- As per ERS/ESC 2016 guidelines, do not screen asymptomatic survivors of PE for CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: D]**
- As per CTS 2010 guidelines, avoid obtaining routine echocardiography or follow-up imaging (V/Q, CT or MRI) to screen for CTEPH in asymptomatic patients following an acute VTE. **[Evidence Level: D]**

### Indications for Testing
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:

- Obtain diagnostic evaluation to assess for CTEPH/CTEPD in patients with persistent or new-onset dyspnea or exercise intolerance after PE. **[Evidence Level: B]**
- Refer symptomatic patients with mismatched perfusion lung defects beyond 3 months of anticoagulation or acute PE to a pulmonary hypertension/CTEPH center, after considering the results of echocardiography, BNP/NT-proBNP, and/or cardiopulmonary exercise testing. **[Evidence Level: B]**

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:

- Evaluate patients with acute PE with risk factors or radiological findings of CTEPH for early diagnosis of CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Consider obtaining accurate assessment of CTPA images used to diagnose PE, individual risk factors for CTEPH, symptoms of functional limitations and/or right HF in the course of PE to identify patients at risk of CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Evaluate for CTEPH in patients with PE optimally at the routine 3-month follow-up visit, but consider obtaining earlier work-up in highly symptomatic or deteriorating patients. **[Evidence Level: E]**

As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:

- Assess for CTEPH with echocardiography and V/Q lung scan in patients with residual dyspnea or exercise intolerance after at least 3 months of uninterrupted anticoagulation post-acute PE. **[Evidence Level: B]**
- Assess the possibility of CTEPH with initial V/Q lung scan in patients being evaluated for pulmonary hypertension. **[Evidence Level: B]**

As per AHA 2011 guidelines:

- Obtain evaluation for CTEPH in patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or clinical evidence of right-sided HF, with or without prior history of symptomatic VTE. **[Evidence Level: B]**
- Consider obtaining echocardiography 6 weeks after an acute PE to screen for persistent pulmonary hypertension to predict the development of CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: C]**

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Echocardiography
As per ERS 2021 guidelines, obtain echocardiography as the test of choice in patients with suspected CTEPH. Consider using the Leiden CTEPH rule-out criteria to exclude the presence of CTEPH and/or to establish an alternative diagnosis. **[Evidence Level: E]**

### Perfusion Imaging
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Obtain V/Q or perfusion lung scan to assess for CTEPH in patients with unexplained pulmonary hypertension. **[Evidence Level: B]**

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Obtain V/Q scintigraphy as the most effective screening tool to exclude CTEPD. Consider obtaining V/Q SPECT over planar imaging. Consider reprojecting 3D planar images from SPECT because the transition from planar imaging to SPECT may not be easy for clinicians unfamiliar with the 3D anatomy. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Do not favor alternative perfusion techniques (such as dual-energy CT and magnetic resonance perfusion) over V/Q because they are more technically challenging and expensive with limited availability and lacking multicenter validation. **[Evidence Level: D]**

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Obtain nuclear V/Q lung scanning instead of CTPA as a screening test to rule out the possibility of CTEPH in patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. **[Evidence Level: B]**
- Consider ruling out the possibility of CTEPH by a normal V/Q. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**
- Do not use the results of V/Q testing to assess the anatomical extent of potentially surgically accessible CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: D]**

### Pulmonary Angiography
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Obtain CTPA in the evaluation of patients with suspected CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: B]**
- Consider obtaining digital subtraction angiography in the evaluation of patients with CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: C]**

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Obtain high-quality CTPA for the diagnosis of proximal CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Do not exclude CTEPH with a negative CTPA, even if high-quality, as distal disease can be missed. **[Evidence Level: D]**
- Insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of cone beam CT and area detector CT, recognizing that they allow more accurate visualization of subsegmental vasculature and have been shown to be useful for procedural guidance for balloon pulmonary angioplasty. **[Evidence Level: I]**
- Recognize that MRI is not fully integrated into the CTEPH diagnostic algorithm, because its use is heavily dependent on local practice and is routinely implemented only in a few high-volume institutions where there is clustering of expertise. **[Evidence Level: E]**

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Consider obtaining positive CTPA routinely to assess the anatomical extent of surgically accessible CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: C]**
- Do not rule out the presence of surgically accessible CTEPH by a negative CTPA and consider obtaining contrast pulmonary angiography. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**
- Avoid obtaining routine magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography in the preoperative assessment of patients with CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: D]**

### Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Consider obtaining cardiopulmonary exercise testing to exclude the presence of CTEPH and/or to establish an alternative diagnosis. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Consider obtaining cardiopulmonary exercise testing and exercise-right heart catheterization to contribute to the definition of CTEPD helping to identify the main cause of exercise limitation in the presence of comorbidities and in patients without resting pulmonary hypertension. **[Evidence Level: E]**

### Antiphospholipid Antibodies
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines, obtain testing for antiphospholipid syndrome in patients with CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: B]**

## Diagnostic Procedures

### Right Heart Catheterization
As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines, perform right heart catheterization in all patients with suspected CTEPH to confirm the hemodynamic diagnosis of precapillary pulmonary hypertension and to assess the severity of pulmonary hypertension. **[Evidence Level: B]**

## Respiratory Support

### Supplemental Oxygen
As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Administer supplemental oxygen in patients with CTEPH exhibiting hypoxemia at rest. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**
- Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of supplemental oxygen in patients with CTEPH manifesting isolated nocturnal and/or exertional oxygen desaturation. **[Evidence Level: I]**

## Medical Management

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Ensure a multidisciplinary team approach considering pulmonary endarterectomy, medical therapy and balloon pulmonary angioplasty for optimal treatment of patients with CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: E]**

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Consider offering cardiopulmonary exercise rehabilitation in patients with CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: C]**

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Consider performing balloon pulmonary angioplasty in technically operable patients with a high proportion of distal disease and an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio for pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: C]**
- Perform balloon pulmonary angioplasty in technically inoperable patients or in patients with residual pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy and distal obstructions amenable to balloon pulmonary angioplasty. **[Evidence Level: B]**
- Consider initiating medical therapy before balloon pulmonary angioplasty. **[Evidence Level: C]**

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:

- Insufficient evidence regarding the potential benefit of hybrid procedures simultaneously combining pulmonary endarterectomy and balloon pulmonary angioplasty in patients with mixed surgically accessible and inaccessible lesions. **[Evidence Level: I]**
- Insufficient evidence to recommend balloon pulmonary angioplasty as a rescue procedure for early failure of pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: I]**
- Recognize that additional balloon pulmonary angioplasty, most often in combination with pulmonary hypertension-targeted medical therapy, is common practice in patients with persistent symptomatic pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Insufficient evidence to recommend preprocedural pulmonary hypertension-targeted therapy to improve the safety of balloon pulmonary angioplasty. **[Evidence Level: I]**

### IVC Filter Placement
As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of IVC filters in patients with CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: I]**

## Perioperative Care

### Preoperative Pharmacotherapy
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Insufficient evidence that preoperative pharmacotherapy is beneficial in patients with operable CTEPH. Consider initiating pulmonary hypertension-targeted drugs as bridging therapy to pulmonary endarterectomy in selected high-risk patients (with high preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance) after multidisciplinary team assessment in expert centers. **[Evidence Level: I]**

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Consider initiating pre-pulmonary endarterectomy treatment with IV epoprostenol in selected patients with severe surgically accessible CTEPH (WHO functional class III or IV with a pulmonary vascular resistance > 1200 dyn•s/cm⁵ and/or RV failure) to improve hemodynamics and operability. **[Evidence Level: C]**
- Decide on instituting pre-pulmonary endarterectomy parenteral epoprostenol therapy at the discretion of a center with experience in treating patients with CTEPH and in consultation with a pulmonary endarterectomy surgeon. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**
- Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of oral pulmonary hypertension-specific medical therapy in patients with CTEPH being considered for pulmonary endarterectomy. Do not delay referral to an expert center for consideration of pulmonary endarterectomy in patients with surgically accessible CTEPH because of the decision to treat patients with CTEPH with oral pulmonary hypertension medications because such a delay may adversely impact the clinical outcome. **[Evidence Level: I]**

## Surgical Interventions

### Pulmonary Endarterectomy
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Perform pulmonary endarterectomy as the treatment of choice in patients with CTEPH and fibrotic obstructions within pulmonary arteries accessible by surgery. **[Evidence Level: B]**

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Consider performing surgery for segmental and subsegmental disease in expert, high-volume centers, recognizing that there is probably considerable anatomical overlap between balloon pulmonary angioplasty and pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Recognize that successful outcome after pulmonary endarterectomy is multifactorial and assumes in-hospital mortality < 5%, survival of 90% at 3 years, improved functional class and QoL. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Recognize that residual pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy presents in ∼ 50% and represents a target for recently introduced medical therapies and balloon pulmonary angioplasty. Consider offering pharmacotherapy and balloon pulmonary angioplasty if post-pulmonary endarterectomy mean pulmonary arterial pressure remains > 30 mmHg in the presence of symptoms. **[Evidence Level: E]**
- Consider ensuring ≥ 50 cases/year and a properly trained surgeon for centers performing pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: E]**

As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:
- Evaluate all patients with CTEPH for pulmonary endarterectomy in consultation with a pulmonary endarterectomy center. **[Evidence Level: B]**

- Consider initiating treprostinil SC in patients with persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: C]**

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Initiate riociguat (an oral guanylate cyclase stimulator) or treprostinil (a subcutaneous prostacyclin analog) in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: E]**

As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:
- Initiate riociguat monotherapy in all patients with residual/recurrent CTEPH post-pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: B]**

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Consider initiating the following monotherapies in patients with symptomatic, residual pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy:
  - Endothelin receptor antagonist (bosentan)
  - PDE5 inhibitor (sildenafil)
  - Parenteral prostanoid (IV epoprostenol or subcutaneous/IV treprostinil), if oral pulmonary hypertension-specific therapy was ineffective or not tolerated **[Evidence Level: C]**
- Insufficient evidence to assess the potential benefits of other endothelin receptor antagonists (such as sitaxsentan and ambrisentan), other phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (such as tadalafil and vardenafil) and oral (such as beraprost) or inhaled (such as iloprost or treprostinil) prostanoids in patients with CTEPH. **[Evidence Level: I]**

### Post-PEA Management, Follow-up
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Obtain long-term follow-up after pulmonary endarterectomy and balloon pulmonary angioplasty, as well as in patients with CTEPH established on medical therapy. **[Evidence Level: B]**

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Consider offering long-term follow-up in a pulmonary hypertension expert center in patients with CTEPH after pulmonary endarterectomy. **[Evidence Level: C]**
