## Background

### Overview

#### Definition
DIC is a clinicopathologic syndrome characterized by systemic activation of widespread coagulation resulting in severe bleeding and organ failure.

#### Pathophysiology
DIC is mostly caused by hypercoagulation (infection, particularly sepsis) and hyperfibrinolysis (acute promyelocytic leukemia, obstetric diseases, or aortic aneurysms).

#### Epidemiology
The incidence of DIC in the US is estimated at 18.6 cases per 100,000 person-years.

#### Disease course
Clinical manifestations include latent and compensated activation of coagulation (no obvious clinical symptoms) and overt DIC (microvascular thrombosis, multi-organ dysfunction, macrovascular thrombi resulting in venous or arterial obstruction and embolization). Sustained thrombin generation results in severe bleeding and an increased risk of death.

#### Prognosis and risk of recurrence
The in-hospital mortality of DIC in critically ill patients is 45%.

## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH 2015,2013), the Italian Society for Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET 2012), and the British Committee for Standards In Haematology (BCSH 2009).

### Clinical findings

#### Symptoms
- Bleeding
- Petechiae
- Past obstetric history
- Current pregnancy

#### Past medical history
- ALF
- Acute pancreatitis
- Acute promyelocytic leukemia
- Liver cirrhosis
- Malignancy
- Pancreatic cancer
- Sepsis
- Traumatic injury

### Screening and diagnosis

#### Diagnosis:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Recognize that there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of DIC and a single test that is, by itself, capable of accurately diagnosing DIC. (⁄)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Diagnose DIC based on both clinical and laboratory evaluation. (B)

### Classification and risk stratification

#### Scoring systems:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Use a scoring system for the diagnosis of DIC, recognizing that the ISTH score correlates with key clinical observations and outcomes. (B)
- **SISET 2012 guidelines**: Consider using any of the following scoring systems to make the diagnosis in patients with suspected DIC:
  - the ISTH score (C)
  - the JMHW score (C)
  - the JAAM score (C)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Use the ISTH DIC scoring system to obtain objective measurement of DIC. (B)

### Diagnostic investigations

#### Laboratory tests
- **SISET 2012 guidelines**: 
  - Avoid using stand-alone laboratory tests in patients with suspected DIC. (D)
  - Consider obtaining D-dimer as a fibrin-related marker considering an increase up to 10 times the ULN as moderate and an increase above this threshold as strong. (C)

### Medical management

#### General principles
**ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Treat the underlying condition as the cornerstone of treatment of DIC. (B)

#### Prothrombin complex concentrate:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Consider administering prothrombin complex concentrate in actively bleeding patients if FFP transfusion is not possible. (⁄)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Consider administering factor concentrates, such as prothrombin complex concentrate, if transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, recognizing that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors. (C)

#### Fibrinogen replacement:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Consider administering fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate in actively bleeding patients with persisting severe hypofibrinogenemia (< 1.5 g/L) despite FFP replacement. (C)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Consider administering fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate in patients with severe hypofibrinogenemia (< 1 g/L) persisting despite FFP replacement. (C)

#### Recombinant factor VIIa
**SISET 2012 guidelines**: Avoid using routine recombinant activated factor VII in bleeding patients with solid tumors or obstetric complications and DIC. (D)

#### Activated protein C:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Insufficient evidence to support the use of activated protein C in patients with DIC. Consider using on a case-by-case basis. (I)
- **SISET 2012 guidelines**: Consider administering recombinant human activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, APACHE II score > 25 (EMEA: at least 2 organs compromised) and DIC. (C)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Consider administering recombinant human-activated protein C (continuous infusion, 24 mcg/kg/hour for 4 days) in patients with severe sepsis and DIC. (B)

#### Intravenous heparin:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Consider administering therapeutic doses of heparin in patients with DIC where thrombosis predominates. Prefer LMWH over UFH. (C)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: 
  - Consider administering therapeutic doses of heparin in patients with DIC with predominating thrombosis, such as arterial or VTE, severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia or vascular skin infarction. (⁄)
  - Consider administering continuous infusion UFH in patients with perceived coexisting high risk of bleeding. Consider administering weight adjusted doses (such as 10 mcg/kg/hour) without the intention of prolonging the aPTT ratio 1.5-2.5 times the control. Observe clinical signs of bleeding because monitoring the aPTT in these patients may be complicated. (C)

#### Antithrombin concentrate:
- **SISET 2012 guidelines**: Avoid using thrombomodulin in patients with hematological cancer or infection and DIC. (D)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Do not administer antithrombin in patients with DIC not receiving heparin. (D)

#### Recombinant thrombomodulin:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Insufficient evidence to support the use of recombinant human thrombomodulin in patients with DIC. Consider using on a case-by-case basis. (I)
- **SISET 2012 guidelines**: Avoid using antithrombin in patients with DIC secondary to severe sepsis/septic shock, obstetric complications, burn injury or advanced liver disease. (D)

#### Dermatan sulfate and gabexate
**SISET 2012 guidelines**: 
- Avoid using dermatan sulfate in patients with DIC and hematological malignancy. (D)
- Avoid using in patients with DIC and sepsis, malignancy, or in patients undergoing surgery. (D)

#### Antifibrinolytic agents:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: 
  - Avoid using antifibrinolytic agents in patients with DIC. (D)
  - Consider administering antifibrinolytic agents in patients with DIC presenting with severe bleeding characterized by a marked hyperfibrinolytic state such as leukemia (C) or trauma (C)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Consider administering lysine analogs, such as tranexamic acid (for example 1 g every 8 hours), in patients with DIC characterized by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state and presenting with severe bleeding. (C)

### Inpatient care

#### Thromboprophylaxis:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Administer prophylaxis for VTE with prophylactic doses of UFH (B) or LMWH in critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, recognizing that there is no direct evidence of the effects of anticoagulants on DIC. (A)
- **SISET 2012 guidelines**: Avoid administering UFH or LMWH in patients with DIC except for thromboembolic prophylaxis in patients at high risk not having active bleeding. (D)

### Therapeutic procedures

#### Indications for transfusion therapy
**SISET 2012 guidelines**: 
- Consider performing transfusion (platelets, plasma, cryoprecipitate) in patients with DIC and active bleeding. (C)
- Avoid performing transfusion solely based on laboratory parameters in patients with chronic DIC or without active bleeding. (D)

#### Platelet transfusion:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Administer platelets in patients with DIC with active bleeding and a platelet count of < 50×10⁹/L or in patients at high risk of bleeding and a platelet count of < 20×10⁹/L. (B)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Do not rely primarily on laboratory results to administer platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC. Reserve it for patients presenting with bleeding. (D)

#### FFP transfusion:
- **ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Consider administering FFP in patients with active bleeding with either prolonged PT/aPTT (> 1.5 times normal) or decreased fibrinogen (< 1.5 g/dL). Consider administering FFP in patients with DIC requiring an invasive procedure with similar laboratory abnormalities. (C)
- **BCSH 2009 guidelines**: Consider administering FFP in bleeding patients with DIC and prolonged PT and aPTT. (C)

#### Plasmapheresis
**SISET 2012 guidelines**: Avoid performing plasma exchange in patients with sepsis and DIC. (D)

### Specific circumstances

#### Patients with malignancy
**ISTH 2015 guidelines**: Consider administering platelets to maintain a platelet count > 50×10⁹/L in patients with DIC and active bleeding. (C)

### Follow-up and surveillance

#### Laboratory follow-up
**ISTH 2013 guidelines**: Obtain repeated tests to monitor the dynamic changes based on laboratory results and clinical observations. (B)
