## Background

### Overview

**Definition**
Cardiac amyloidosis refers to infiltration of the heart muscle by amyloid proteins, resulting in cardiomyopathy.¹

**Pathophysiology**
Cardiac amyloidosis is caused by extracellular accumulation of misfolded protein fragments (immunoglobulin light-chain and transthyretin protein) in the heart muscle.¹

**Disease course**
Clinical manifestations are related to the development of restrictive cardiomyopathy and include angina, myocardial infarction, and HF. An increased risk of thromboembolic complications is also present.¹

**Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
Unadjusted 5-year mortality rates are estimated at 65% in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis and 44% in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.²

## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of cardiac amyloidosis are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2023,2021), the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA/AHA/ACC 2022), the Canadian Heart Failure Society (CHFS/CCS 2020), the American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2019), the Amyloidosis Research Consortium (ARC 2019), and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS 2019).

*Julian D Gillmore et al. N Engl J Med. 2024 Jan 11.*

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Indications for testing:

**As per CCS/CHFS 2020 guidelines**, obtain diagnostic workup for cardiac amyloidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of HF having ≥ 1 of the following features:
- unexplained increased LV wall thickness
- > 60 years of age with low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis and LVEF > 40%
- unexplained peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy and/or dysautonomia
- history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
- established light chain or transthyretin amyloidosis **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per ARC 2019 guidelines:**
- Suspect transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in older persons who have been hospitalized for HF, elevated troponin levels, or levels of NT-proBNP that are out of proportion to the clinical context **[Evidence Level E]**
- Consider evaluation of myocardial uptake on bone scintigraphy in patients with HF, unexplained neuropathy, a family history of amyloidosis, or unexplained increased LV wall thickness **[Evidence Level E]**

## Classification and Risk Stratification

**Risk stratification**: as per CCS/CHFS 2020 guidelines, use a validated serum biomarker-based staging system, including troponin and/or BNP/NT-proBNP, to risk-stratify patients with cardiac amyloidosis **[Evidence Level A]**

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Clinical history
As per ARC 2019 guidelines, recognize the following history/examination diagnostic clues to ATTR cardiomyopathy:
- evidence of right-sided HF (e.g., hepatomegaly, ascites, and lower extremity edema)
- HFpEF, particularly in men
- intolerance to ACE inhibitors or β-blockers
- bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
- lumbar spinal stenosis
- biceps tendon rupture
- unexplained peripheral neuropathy (e.g., loss of warm/cold discrimination), particularly if associated with autonomic dysfunction (e.g., postural hypotension, alternating bowel pattern)
- unexplained atrial arrhythmias or conduction system disease/need for a pacemaker **[Evidence Level E]**

### Testing for monoclonal protein:

**As per ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines**, screen for serum and urine monoclonal light chains with serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis and sFLC in patients with a clinical suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per CCS/CHFS 2020 guidelines**, obtain serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation and sFLC in all patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis to evaluate for possible light chain amyloidosis or other plasma cell dyscrasia **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per ARC 2019 guidelines:**
- Obtain testing for monoclonal protein followed by scintigraphy or biopsy as part of the evaluation of patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis **[Evidence Level E]**
- Obtain the following three tests to screen for the presence of a monoclonal protein in patients with symptoms, ECG, echocardiography, MRI, or biomarkers suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis:
  - serum kappa/lambda free light chain ratio (abnormal if the ratio is < 0.26 or > 1.65)
  - serum protein immunofixation (abnormal if monoclonal protein is detected)
  - urine protein immunofixation (abnormal if monoclonal protein is detected) **[Evidence Level E]**

### Evaluation for HF

**As per CCS/CHFS 2020 guidelines:**
- Obtain routine investigations for the evaluation of HF including 12-lead ECG, troponin, and BNP/NT-proBNP in patients presenting with suspected cardiac amyloidosis **[Evidence Level B]**
- Obtain echocardiography with longitudinal LV strain measurement or cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement and T1 mapping in all patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis to evaluate for characteristic features of cardiac amyloidosis or alternative causes of HF **[Evidence Level B]**

### Radionuclide imaging:

**As per ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines**, obtain bone scintigraphy to confirm the presence of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in patients with high clinical suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis without evidence of serum or urine monoclonal light chains **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per CCS/CHFS 2020 guidelines**, obtain nuclear scintigraphy with bone-seeking radiotracer, if available, to evaluate for cardiac involvement when transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is suspected after exclusion of light chain amyloidosis **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per ARC 2019 guidelines:**
- Obtain noninvasive evaluation with bone scintigraphy in patients with negative screening for the presence of a monoclonal protein **[Evidence Level E]**
- Consider obtaining radionuclide scintigraphy alone, without myocardial biopsy, to diagnose ATTR cardiomyopathy in patients with no detected monoclonal protein and if a diagnosis of AL cardiac amyloidosis is excluded **[Evidence Level E]**
- Refer for bone scintigraphy or perform an endomyocardial biopsy in patients with negative screening for the presence of a monoclonal protein, if bone scintigraphy is not available **[Evidence Level E]**

**Recognize the following imaging diagnostic clues to ATTR cardiomyopathy:**
- myocardial uptake on 99mTc pyrophosphate/diphosphonopropanodicarboxylic acid or HMDP imaging
- infiltrative phenotype (such as biventricular hypertrophy pericardial effusion, valve thickening, interatrial septal thickening)
- diffuse subendocardial or transmural late gadolinium enhancement or increased extracellular volume fraction on cardiac MRI
- apical sparing on longitudinal strain imaging
- low myocardial contraction fraction
- restrictive LV filling with RV wall thickening **[Evidence Level E]**

### ATTR genotyping:

**As per ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines**, obtain genetic testing with transthyretin gene sequencing to differentiate hereditary variant from wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in patients diagnosed with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per CCS/CHFS 2020 guidelines**, obtain genetic testing to differentiate hereditary transthyretin from wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis in patients with a diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per ARC 2019 guidelines**, perform TTR genotyping in patients in whom a diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis is made on biopsy **[Evidence Level E]**

## Diagnostic Procedures

### Endomyocardial biopsy:

**As per CCS/CHFS 2020 guidelines**, perform endomyocardial biopsy for diagnosis and subtyping with mass spectrometry or immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence, if available, when the existing diagnostic workup for cardiac amyloidosis is equivocal or discordant with clinical suspicion **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per ARC 2019 guidelines:**
- Perform an endomyocardial biopsy to definitively diagnose ATTR cardiomyopathy in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance **[Evidence Level E]**
- Consider performing endomyocardial biopsy in patients with negative screening for the presence of a monoclonal protein, if bone scintigraphy is negative or indeterminate, but suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis is high **[Evidence Level E]**

### Tissue biopsy

**As per ARC 2019 guidelines:**
- Perform a tissue biopsy from a clinically affected organ (endomyocardial biopsy if the heart is clinically affected), abdominal fat, or bone marrow biopsy if a monoclonal protein is detected, depending on availability and expertise at the clinic **[Evidence Level E]**
- Perform biopsy of an involved organ in patients with negative fat pad biopsy **[Evidence Level E]**

## Medical Management
