## Background

### Overview

#### Definition
AF is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by a diffuse and abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the atria of the heart. AF is classified as valvular or nonvalvular based on the presence or absence of valvular heart disease, specifically MS, or a prosthetic heart valve.

#### Pathophysiology
The development of AF is related to structural and electrophysiological abnormalities resulting from comorbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, HF), genetics, sex, and other factors.

#### Epidemiology
The prevalence of AF in the US ranges is estimated at 700-775 cases per 100,000 persons.

#### Disease Course
In patients with AF, rapid and irregular atrial contractions lead to tachyarrhythmias, which lead to symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and an increased risk of HF; as well as stasis of blood in the LAA, which increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism.

#### Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence
AF is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke and a 2-fold risk for all-cause mortality, respectively.

## Guidelines

### Key Sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of atrial fibrillation are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC 2025), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP 2024,2017), the American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC/ACCP 2024), the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS/CAIC 2024), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC/EACTS 2024,2021), the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO 2024), and other major medical organizations.

### Screening and Diagnosis

#### Indications for Screening (General Population)
**As per EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Obtain routine heart rhythm assessment during healthcare contact in all individuals aged ≥ 65 years for earlier detection of AF.

- **Level C**: Consider obtaining population-based screening for AF using a prolonged noninvasive ECG-based approach in individuals aged ≥ 75 years, or ≥ 65 years with additional CHA2DS2-VA risk factors to ensure earlier detection of AF.

**As per USPSTF 2022 guidelines:**

- **Level I**: Insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF in individuals aged ≥ 50 years without a diagnosis or symptoms of AF and without a history of TIA or stroke.

**As per CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Obtain opportunistic screening for AF in individuals aged ≥ 65 years at the time of medical encounters.

**As per CSANZ/NHFA 2018 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Obtain opportunistic point-of-care screening for AF in the clinic or community in individuals aged ≥ 65 years.

#### Indications for Screening (Stroke)
**As per ACC 2025 guidelines:**

- **Level E**: Consider obtaining rhythm monitoring in patients with stroke from presumed cardioembolic origin only if there is consideration of stopping anticoagulation or there are other treatment decisions that depend on arrhythmia detection.

- **Level E**: Consider obtaining rhythm monitoring in patients with ischemic stroke from presumed small- or large-vessel disease for 2-4 weeks. Initiate oral anticoagulation when an AF event ≥ 5 minutes is identified.

- **Level E**: Consider obtaining extended monitoring with an implantable cardiac monitor in patients with ischemic stroke from presumed small- or large-vessel diseased, especially in patients with higher risk criteria for the development of AF.

- **Level E**: Offer cardiac monitoring for 2-4 weeks in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source eligible for long-term anticoagulation if AF is identified.

- **Level E**: Consider offering an implantable monitor in selected patients with higher risk of post-stroke AF among those with a recent embolic stroke of undetermined source and no identified cause by external monitoring.

- **Level E**: Consider initiating anticoagulation in patients with AF events ≥ 5 minutes, particularly in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 3 or equivalent stroke risk.

- **Level D**: Do not use anticoagulation in patients with a very low burden of AF (< 5 minutes) without other indications.

**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level C**: Consider obtaining implantable cardiac monitoring in patients with a history of a systemic thromboembolic event without a known history of AF if maximum sensitivity to detect AF is sought.

- **Level C**: Consider obtaining initial cardiac monitoring and, if needed, extended monitoring with an implantable loop recorder to improve the detection of AF in patients with stroke or TIA of undetermined cause.

#### Indications for Screening (Previous Atrial Arrhythmias)
**As per CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Obtain opportunistic screening for AF at the time of medical encounters in patients with a history of ablation of an atrial dysrhythmia (atrial flutter, AT, AVRT, AVNRT).

#### Indications for Screening (Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices)
**As per CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Assess atrial high-rate episodes during cardiac implantable electronic device (loop recorders, pacemakers, or implanted cardioverter-defibrillators) interrogation.

**As per CSANZ/NHFA 2018 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Interrogate pacemakers and defibrillators regularly for atrial high-rate episodes and confirm AF by electrogram.

#### Confirmatory Testing
**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Make an initial diagnosis of AF using visual interpretation of the ECG signals, regardless of the type of rhythm or monitoring device, in patients without a known history of AF.

- **Level B**: Make a diagnosis of AF in patients with an intracardiac rhythm device capable of diagnosing AF, such as from an atrial pacemaker lead, only after visually confirming by a review of intracardiac tracings to exclude signal artifacts and other arrhythmias.

**As per EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level A**: Obtain an ECG (12-lead, multiple, or single leads) to confirm the diagnosis of clinical AF and initiate risk stratification and treatment.

- **Level B**: Review an ECG (12-lead, single, or multiple leads) to provide a definite diagnosis of AF and initiate appropriate management.

**As per CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Obtain downstream confirmatory testing when AF is suspected but not documented or when the documentation method does not include ECG rhythm acquisition.

### Classification and Risk Stratification

#### Stroke Risk Assessment
**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Assess the annual risk of thromboembolic events using a validated clinical risk score, such as the CHA2DS2-VASc score, in patients with AF.

- **Level B**: Take into consideration factors that might modify the risk of stroke to help inform the decision in patients with AF at intermediate annual risk of thromboembolic events (based on risk scores, such as equivalent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in males or 2 in females) remaining uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation.

- Bleeding risk assessment

### Diagnostic Investigations

#### Evaluation of Palpitations
**As per AAFP 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Obtain a 12-lead ECG as part of the initial evaluation of patients with palpitations to screen for structural and ischemic heart disease, conduction disorders, and arrhythmias. Recognize that ambulatory ECG monitoring for 2 weeks has the highest diagnostic yield-to-cost ratio in the evaluation of palpitations of unknown etiology.

- **Level B**: Obtain echocardiography if history, physical examination, or ECG results raise concern for structural heart disease.

- **Level B**: Transfer patients experiencing palpitations in the presence of hemodynamic instability, syncope, ischemic chest pain, signs of HF, or ischemic or syndromic ECG changes to the emergency department with immediate cardiology referral.

- **Level B**: Recognize that the use of smartphone-based ambulatory cardiac monitoring devices is highly diagnostic for AF, the most common arrhythmia causing palpitations, but other forms of arrhythmia detection are less clear.

### Medical Management

#### General Principles
**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level A**: Provide comprehensive care addressing guideline-directed lifestyle risk factor modification, AF symptoms, risk of stroke, and other associated medical conditions to reduce AF burden, progression, or consequences.

- **Level C**: Consider using clinical care pathways, such as nurse-led AF clinics, to promote comprehensive, team-based care and to enhance adherence to evidence-based therapies for AF and associated conditions.

- **Level C**: Consider using evidence-based decision aids to guide stroke reduction therapy treatment decisions throughout the disease course to improve engagement, decisional quality, and patient satisfaction in patients with AF.

- **Level B**: Ensure shared decision-making with the patient to discuss rhythm control versus rate control strategies (taking into consideration clinical presentation, comorbidity burden, medication profile, and patient preferences) and therapeutic options and assess long-term benefits in patients with AF.

- **Level B**: Offer guideline-directed stroke risk reduction therapies and rate or rhythm control strategies and lifestyle risk factor modification as indicated to improve QoL and prevent adverse outcomes in patients with AF, regardless of sex and gender diversity, race and ethnicity, or adverse social determinants of health.

### Therapeutic Procedures

#### Catheter Ablation (Indications)
**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Consider performing catheter ablation to improve symptoms in patients with symptomatic AF if antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, contraindicated, not tolerated, or not preferred, and continued rhythm control is desired.

- **Level B**: Consider performing catheter ablation as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF in selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF if rhythm control is desired.

- **Level C**: Consider performing ablation of additional clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias to reduce the likelihood of future arrhythmia in patients undergoing ablation for AF.

- **Level C**: Consider performing catheter ablation as first-line therapy to improve symptoms in patients (other than younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF being managed with a rhythm-control strategy.

- **Level C**: Consider performing catheter ablation to reduce the progression of AF and its associated complications in selected patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AF.

- **Level B**: Consider performing repeat catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy to improve symptoms and freedom from AF in patients with recurrent symptomatic AF after catheter ablation.

### Perioperative Care

#### Pre-procedural Anticoagulation Interruption
**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level B**: Interrupt oral anticoagulation without bridging anticoagulation in patients with AF, excluding patients with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve, receiving oral anticoagulation with either warfarin or a DOAC scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure or surgery.

- **Level A**: Prefer continued anticoagulation over interruption of warfarin and bridging anticoagulation with heparin to reduce the risk of pocket hematoma in patients with AF receiving warfarin and an annual predicted risk of thromboembolism of ≥ 5% undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change.

- **Level B**: Consider offering either uninterrupted or interrupted DOACs in patients with AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent risk of stroke receiving DOACs undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change.

- **Level B**: Guide the timing of interruption of DOACs by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure in patients with AF receiving DOACs scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure or surgery impossible to perform safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation.

#### More Topics in This Section:
- Pre-procedural anticoagulation bridging
- Post-procedural resumption of anticoagulation

### Surgical Interventions

#### LAA Closure (Indications)
**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**

- **Level C**: Consider performing percutaneous LAA occlusion in patients with AF, a moderate-to-high risk of stroke (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2), and contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation due to a nonreversible cause.

- **Level C**: Consider performing percutaneous LAA occlusion as an alternative to oral anticoagulation based on patient preference in patients with AF, a moderate-to-high risk of stroke, and a high risk of major bleeding on oral anticoagulation, with careful consideration of procedural risk and with the understanding that the evidence for oral anticoagulation is more extensive.

- **Level A**: Perform surgical LAA exclusion, in addition to continued anticoagulation, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent stroke risk.

- **Level I**: Insufficient evidence to recommend surgical LAA exclusion without continued anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent stroke risk.
