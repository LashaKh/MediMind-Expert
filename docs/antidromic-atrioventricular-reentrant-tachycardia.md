## Background

### Overview

**Definition**  
Antidromic AVRT is a type of SVT where the electrical impulses in the heart travel in an abnormal, reverse direction, leading to a rapid HR.

**Pathophysiology**  
The pathophysiology of antidromic AVRT involves an abnormal accessory pathway in the heart that allows electrical impulses to bypass the normal conduction system. This creates a reentrant circuit, leading to rapid HRs. In some cases, the bypass tract serves as the anterograde limb of the circuit and the atrioventricular node as the retrograde limb of the reentrant circuit.

**Epidemiology**  
Antidromic AVRT is a rare condition with an estimated incidence of 8% in patients with pre-excitation syndrome.

**Disease Course**  
Clinically, patients with antidromic AVRT may present with symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. However, in some cases, patients may be asymptomatic.

**Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**  
The prognosis of antidromic AVRT is generally benign, but it can lead to severe complications in rare instances.

## Clinical Presentation

### Symptoms
- Palpitations
- Dizziness  
- Shortness of breath
- May be asymptomatic in some cases

### Patient Demographics
- Occurs in patients with pre-excitation syndrome
- Rare condition (8% incidence in pre-excitation syndrome patients)

## Guidelines

### Key Sources
The following summarized guidelines for the management of antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the **European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2020)**.

## Medical Management

### Acute Management

#### Hemodynamically Stable Patients
**As per ESC 2020 guidelines:**

**Consider administering IV formulations of the following medications for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with antidromic AVRT if vagal maneuvers and adenosine fail:**
- ibutilide
- procainamide  
- flecainide
- propafenone  
**Evidence Level: Class C**

**Consider administering IV amiodarone for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with refractory antidromic AVRT.**  
**Evidence Level: Class C**

### Ongoing Management

**Consider initiating the following medications for the management of patients with antidromic AVRT and without signs of pre-excitation on resting ECG, if ablation is not desirable or feasible:**
- β-blockers
- nondihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil or diltiazem) in the absence of HFrEF  
**Evidence Level: Class IIa, Level B**

**Consider initiating the following medications for the management of patients with antidromic AVRT and without ischemic or structural heart disease, if ablation is not desirable or feasible:**
- propafenone
- flecainide  
**Evidence Level: Class C**

#### Contraindications

**Do not use the following medications in patients with pre-excited AF:**
- β-blockers
- nondihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil or diltiazem)
- digoxin
- amiodarone  
**Evidence Level: Class D**

## Nonpharmacologic Interventions

### Vagal Maneuvers
**As per ESC 2020 guidelines:** Perform vagal maneuvers, preferably in the supine position with leg elevation, for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with antidromic AVRT.  
**Evidence Level: Class B**

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Synchronized Electrical Cardioversion

**Perform synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically unstable patients with antidromic AVRT.**  
**Evidence Level: Class B**

**Perform synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with antidromic AVRT if drug therapy fails to convert or control the tachycardia.**  
**Evidence Level: Class B**

**Consider performing synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with antidromic AVRT if vagal maneuvers and adenosine fail.**  
**Evidence Level: Class C**

### Catheter Ablation
**As per ESC 2020 guidelines:** Perform catheter ablation of accessory pathways in patients with symptomatic, recurrent antidromic AVRT.  
**Evidence Level: Class B**
