# Complete Guide: Converting MD Files to Structured Disease Data

## üìã **Pre-Conversion Checklist**

### 1. **Analyze the Source MD File Structure**
```markdown
# Main Title
## Background/Overview sections
## Clinical findings
## Guidelines/Management sections  
## Studies/Research
## References with links
```

### 2. **Identify All Content Types**
- [ ] Headers and subheaders
- [ ] Bullet points and numbered lists
- [ ] Tables and structured data
- [ ] **Links** (PubMed, guidelines, external resources)
- [ ] **Recommendation levels** (Class I, IIa, IIb, III; Level A, B, C)
- [ ] Medical terminology and abbreviations
- [ ] Statistical data and percentages

---

## üîÑ **Step-by-Step Conversion Process**

### **STEP 1: Extract Background Content**
```typescript
background: {
  overview: {
    definition: "Copy EXACT definition from MD file",
    pathophysiology: "Copy ALL pathophysiology content",
    epidemiology: "Include ALL statistics, prevalence data", 
    diseaseCourse: "Copy complete disease progression info",
    prognosis: "Include ALL prognostic factors and outcomes"
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Copy every sentence, statistic, and medical term exactly as written.

### **STEP 2: Extract Clinical Findings**
```typescript
clinicalFindings: {
  patientDemographics: [
    "Copy each demographic bullet point exactly",
    "Include age ranges, gender distributions",
    "Don't miss any population-specific data"
  ],
  pastMedicalHistory: [
    "Copy ALL medical history items",
    "Include comorbidities and risk factors",
    "Preserve exact medical terminology"
  ],
  symptoms: [
    "Copy ALL symptoms listed",
    "Include frequency percentages if given",
    "Preserve clinical descriptions exactly"
  ]
}
```

### **STEP 3: Extract Studies (Research Papers)**
```typescript
studies: [
  {
    title: "EXACT title from MD file",
    year: "Publication year", 
    description: "Copy COMPLETE description without shortening",
    authors: "All authors as listed",
    journal: "Complete journal citation",
    link: "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMID/" // ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Include PubMed link for clickability
  }
]
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: STUDIES MUST HAVE CLICKABLE LINKS**
- Every study MUST include a working PubMed link
- Use exact PubMed URLs from the MD file
- If MD doesn't have links, search PubMed for the exact study
- Studies without links are NOT clickable in the UI

### **STEP 4: Convert Guidelines Section**

#### **4A: Identify Guideline Categories**
From MD file structure like:
```markdown
## Acute Rate Control
## Rhythm Control  
## Anticoagulation
## Long-term Management
```

#### **4B: Structure Each Category**
```typescript
guidelines: {
  keySources: "List ALL guideline sources mentioned",
  sections: [
    {
      title: "Exact section title from MD",
      id: "kebab-case-id",
      content: [
        {
          statement: "Copy EXACT guideline statement",
          level: "A", // ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Use ONLY the letter (A, B, C, D) - NOT "Class A"
          source: "Specific guideline source",
          subsections: [ // If applicable
            {
              title: "Subsection title",
              id: "subsection-id", 
              content: [
                {
                  statement: "Detailed recommendation",
                  level: "B", // ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Just the letter, UI adds "Class" automatically
                  source: "Source guideline"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **STEP 5: Extract ALL References with Links**

#### **5A: Create Reference List**
For each reference in MD:
```markdown
1. Author et al. Title. Journal. Year. [PubMed Link]
```

Convert to:
```typescript
{
  id: 1,
  authors: "EXACT author list from MD",
  title: "EXACT title without modification", 
  journal: "Complete journal citation",
  year: "Year",
  link: "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMID/" // ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Include ALL links
}
```

#### **5B: Find PubMed Links**
- If MD has direct links ‚Üí Copy exactly
- If no links ‚Üí Search PubMed using: `"Title" + First Author + Year`
- Verify PMID matches the citation exactly

## ‚úÖ **Quality Control Checklist**

### **Content Completeness**
- [ ] **Every sentence** from MD is included somewhere
- [ ] **All bullet points** are preserved  
- [ ] **All tables/lists** are converted to appropriate format
- [ ] **All medical terminology** is exact (no paraphrasing)
- [ ] **All statistics/percentages** are included

### **Recommendation Levels** 
- [ ] **Class recommendations** are converted to single letters only (A, B, C, D)
- [ ] **Evidence levels** are NOT included (UI handles display formatting)  
- [ ] **Level format** is just the letter: "A", "B", "C", or "D" (NO "Class" prefix)
- [ ] **No recommendation levels** are missing or modified

### **Links and References**
- [ ] **All PubMed links** are functional and correct
- [ ] **All studies have clickable links** in the link field
- [ ] **Reference count** matches MD file exactly
- [ ] **Citation format** is preserved exactly
- [ ] **All external links** are included

### **Structure Validation**
- [ ] **Section titles** match MD headers exactly
- [ ] **Content organization** follows MD structure
- [ ] **Subsections** are properly nested
- [ ] **ID fields** use consistent kebab-case

---

## üö® **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

### **‚ùå Content Loss**
- Skipping "minor" details or statistics
- Shortening long medical descriptions
- Omitting subsections or bullet points
- Missing recommendation levels
- Adding "Class" prefix to level field (UI adds this automatically)

### **‚ùå Link Issues** 
- Not including PubMed links for references
- **Missing clickable links in studies section**
- Using incorrect PMID numbers
- Missing external guideline links
- Broken or non-functional URLs

### **‚ùå Structure Problems**
- Inconsistent ID naming (use kebab-case)
- Missing subsections for complex guidelines
- Incorrect nesting of content arrays
- Wrong recommendation level format

### **‚ùå UI Display Issues**
- **CRITICAL**: Sections not appearing expanded in UI even though content exists
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Section IDs not included in `expandedSectionsList` in `/src/components/Diseases/DiseasePage.tsx`
- **SYMPTOMS**: Section headers appear but clicking shows no content underneath
- **SOLUTION**: Add section IDs to the `expandedSectionsList` array (lines 43-59)
- **MUST ADD**: Any new major guideline section IDs like 'vasopressors', 'nonvasopressor-medications', 'management-of-arrhythmias'

---

## üõ† **Validation Tools**

### **1. Content Comparison**
```bash
# Count words in original MD
wc -w original-file.md

# Count content in TypeScript (approximate)
# Manually verify all major sections are present
```

### **2. Link Validation** 
```javascript
// Test all PubMed links
references.forEach(ref => {
  if (ref.link) {
    console.log(`Testing: ${ref.link}`);
    // Manually click each link to verify
  }
});
```

### **3. Build Verification**
```bash
npm run build
# Must pass without TypeScript errors
```

## üìù **Example Conversion Workflow**

### **Input MD Structure:**
```markdown
# Atrial Flutter

## Background
Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia...

## Clinical Presentation
- Palpitations (85% of patients)
- Dyspnea (60% of patients)

## Management Guidelines

### Acute Rate Control
- **Class I, Level A**: Beta-blockers for rate control
- **Class IIa, Level B**: Calcium channel blockers

## References
1. Smith J et al. Atrial flutter management. Cardiology. 2023. PMID: 12345678
```

### **Output TypeScript Structure:**
```typescript
export const atrialFlutterData: DiseaseData = {
  id: 'atrial-flutter',
  title: 'Atrial Flutter', // Exact from MD
  content: {
    background: {
      overview: {
        definition: 'Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia...', // Exact copy
      }
    },
    clinicalFindings: {
      symptoms: [
        'Palpitations (85% of patients)', // Exact with percentages
        'Dyspnea (60% of patients)'
      ]
    },
    guidelines: {
      sections: [{
        title: 'Acute Rate Control', // Exact header
        content: [{
          statement: 'Beta-blockers for rate control',
          level: 'A', // Just the letter - UI adds "Class" automatically
          source: 'ACC/AHA Guidelines'
        }, {
          statement: 'Calcium channel blockers',
          level: 'B', // Just the letter - UI adds "Class" automatically
          source: 'ACC/AHA Guidelines'
        }]
      }]
    },
    references: [{
      id: 1,
      authors: 'Smith J et al.', // Exact authors
      title: 'Atrial flutter management', // Exact title
      journal: 'Cardiology. 2023', // Exact journal
      year: '2023',
      link: 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12345678/' // Functional link
    }]
  }
};
```
