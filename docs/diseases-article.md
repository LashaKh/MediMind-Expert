# Complete Guide: Converting MD Files to Structured Disease Data

## 📋 **Pre-Conversion Checklist**

### 1. **Analyze the Source MD File Structure**
```markdown
# Main Title
## Background/Overview sections
## Clinical findings
## Guidelines/Management sections  
## Studies/Research
## References with links
```

### 2. **Identify All Content Types**
- [ ] Headers and subheaders
- [ ] Bullet points and numbered lists
- [ ] Tables and structured data
- [ ] **Links** (PubMed, guidelines, external resources)
- [ ] **Recommendation levels** (Class I, IIa, IIb, III; Level A, B, C)
- [ ] Medical terminology and abbreviations
- [ ] Statistical data and percentages

---

## 🔄 **Step-by-Step Conversion Process**

### **STEP 1: Extract Background Content**
```typescript
background: {
  overview: {
    definition: "Copy EXACT definition from MD file",
    pathophysiology: "Copy ALL pathophysiology content",
    epidemiology: "Include ALL statistics, prevalence data", 
    diseaseCourse: "Copy complete disease progression info",
    prognosis: "Include ALL prognostic factors and outcomes"
  }
}
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Copy every sentence, statistic, and medical term exactly as written.

### **STEP 2: Extract Clinical Findings**
```typescript
clinicalFindings: {
  patientDemographics: [
    "Copy each demographic bullet point exactly",
    "Include age ranges, gender distributions",
    "Don't miss any population-specific data"
  ],
  pastMedicalHistory: [
    "Copy ALL medical history items",
    "Include comorbidities and risk factors",
    "Preserve exact medical terminology"
  ],
  symptoms: [
    "Copy ALL symptoms listed",
    "Include frequency percentages if given",
    "Preserve clinical descriptions exactly"
  ]
}
```

### **STEP 3: Extract Studies (Research Papers)**
```typescript
studies: [
  {
    title: "EXACT title from MD file",
    year: "Publication year", 
    description: "Copy COMPLETE description without shortening",
    authors: "All authors as listed",
    journal: "Complete journal citation"
  }
]
```

### **STEP 4: Convert Guidelines Section**

#### **4A: Identify Guideline Categories**
From MD file structure like:
```markdown
## Acute Rate Control
## Rhythm Control  
## Anticoagulation
## Long-term Management
```

#### **4B: Structure Each Category**
```typescript
guidelines: {
  keySources: "List ALL guideline sources mentioned",
  sections: [
    {
      title: "Exact section title from MD",
      id: "kebab-case-id",
      content: [
        {
          statement: "Copy EXACT guideline statement",
          level: "Class I, Level A", // ⚠️ CRITICAL: Don't miss recommendation levels
          source: "Specific guideline source",
          subsections: [ // If applicable
            {
              title: "Subsection title",
              id: "subsection-id", 
              content: [
                {
                  statement: "Detailed recommendation",
                  level: "Class IIa, Level B",
                  source: "Source guideline"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **STEP 5: Extract ALL References with Links**

#### **5A: Create Reference List**
For each reference in MD:
```markdown
1. Author et al. Title. Journal. Year. [PubMed Link]
```

Convert to:
```typescript
{
  id: 1,
  authors: "EXACT author list from MD",
  title: "EXACT title without modification", 
  journal: "Complete journal citation",
  year: "Year",
  link: "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMID/" // ⚠️ CRITICAL: Include ALL links
}
```

#### **5B: Find PubMed Links**
- If MD has direct links → Copy exactly
- If no links → Search PubMed using: `"Title" + First Author + Year`
- Verify PMID matches the citation exactly

## 🚨 **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

### **❌ Content Loss**
- Skipping "minor" details or statistics
- Shortening long medical descriptions
- Omitting subsections or bullet points
- Missing recommendation levels

### **❌ Link Issues** 
- Not including PubMed links for references

- Broken or non-functional URLs

### **❌ Structure Problems**
- Inconsistent ID naming (use kebab-case)
- Missing subsections for complex guidelines
- Incorrect nesting of content arrays
- Wrong recommendation level format

---

## 🛠 **Validation Tools**

### **1. Content Comparison**
```bash
# Count words in original MD
wc -w original-file.md

# Count content in TypeScript (approximate)
# Manually verify all major sections are present
```

### **2. Link Validation** 
```javascript
// Test all PubMed links
references.forEach(ref => {
  if (ref.link) {
    console.log(`Testing: ${ref.link}`);
    // Manually click each link to verify
  }
});
```

### **3. Build Verification**
```bash
npm run build
# Must pass without TypeScript errors
```

## 📝 **Example Conversion Workflow**

### **Input MD Structure:**
```markdown
# Atrial Flutter

## Background

## Clinical Presentation
- Palpitations (85% of patients)
- Dyspnea (60% of patients)

## Management Guidelines

### Acute Rate Control
- **Class I, Level A**: Beta-blockers for rate control
- **Class IIa, Level B**: Calcium channel blockers

## References

      }
    },
    clinicalFindings: {
      symptoms: [
        'Palpitations (85% of patients)', // Exact with percentages
        'Dyspnea (60% of patients)'
      ]
    },
    guidelines: {
      sections: [{
        title: 'Acute Rate Control', // Exact header
        content: [{
          statement: 'Beta-blockers for rate control',
          level: 'Class I, Level A', // Exact recommendation level
          source: 'ACC/AHA Guidelines'
        }, {
          statement: 'Calcium channel blockers',
          level: 'Class IIa, Level B', // Exact recommendation level  
          source: 'ACC/AHA Guidelines'
        }]
      }]
    },
    references: [{
      id: 1,
      authors: 'Smith J et al.', // Exact authors
      title: 'Atrial flutter management', // Exact title
      journal: 'Cardiology. 2023', // Exact journal
      year: '2023',
      link: 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12345678/' // Functional link
    }]
  }
};
```
