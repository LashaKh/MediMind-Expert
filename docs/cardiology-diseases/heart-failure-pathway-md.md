## Background

### Overview

#### Definition
HF is a clinical syndrome that results from structural or functional impairment of filling or ejection of blood from the heart. HF can be associated with either reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%), preserved ejection fraction (≥ 50%), or borderline ejection fraction (41-50%).

#### Pathophysiology
The most common causes of HF include ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, valvular and rheumatic heart disease, genetic cardiomyopathies, and congenital heart disease.

#### Epidemiology
In the US, the age and sex-adjusted incidence of HF is estimated at 219.3 cases per 100,000 person-years. Its prevalence is estimated at 1915 persons per 100,000 population.

#### Disease course
Clinical manifestations relate to pulmonary edema (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), peripheral edema (ankle swelling, abdominal bloating), and activation of inflammatory pathways (early satiety, cachexia). Severe HF leads to manifestations related to hypoperfusion, spanning from mild fatigue and exertional intolerance to cardiogenic shock.

#### Prognosis and risk of recurrence
The 1-year and 5-year mortality associated with HF are estimated at 20.2% and 56.2%, respectively. Death is due to non-cardiovascular events in over 50% of patients.

  - reduce the risk of subsequent re-hospitalization for HF
  - improve survival **[Evidence Level: A]**

- Refer patients with high-risk HF, particularly with recurrent hospitalizations for HFrEF, to multidisciplinary HF disease management programs to reduce the risk of hospitalization. **[Evidence Level: B]**

- Consider offering participation in systems allowing benchmarking to performance measures to increase use of evidence-based therapy and to improve quality of care in patients hospitalized with worsening HF. **[Evidence Level: C]**

- Titrate guideline-directed medication dosing in patients with HFrEF to achieve target doses shown to be efficacious in RCTs to reduce cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalizations unless not well tolerated. **[Evidence Level: A]**

- Consider titrating and optimizing guideline-directed medications as frequently as every 1-2 weeks depending on the patients symptoms, vital signs and laboratory findings to optimize management in patients with HFrEF. **[Evidence Level: C]**
