## Background

### Overview

#### Definition
HF is a clinical syndrome that results from structural or functional impairment of filling or ejection of blood from the heart. HF can be associated with either reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%), preserved ejection fraction (≥ 50%), or borderline ejection fraction (41-50%).

#### Pathophysiology
The most common causes of HF include ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, valvular and rheumatic heart disease, genetic cardiomyopathies, and congenital heart disease.

#### Epidemiology
In the US, the age and sex-adjusted incidence of HF is estimated at 219.3 cases per 100,000 person-years. Its prevalence is estimated at 1915 persons per 100,000 population.

#### Disease course
Clinical manifestations relate to pulmonary edema (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), peripheral edema (ankle swelling, abdominal bloating), and activation of inflammatory pathways (early satiety, cachexia). Severe HF leads to manifestations related to hypoperfusion, spanning from mild fatigue and exertional intolerance to cardiogenic shock.

#### Prognosis and risk of recurrence
The 1-year and 5-year mortality associated with HF are estimated at 20.2% and 56.2%, respectively. Death is due to non-cardiovascular events in over 50% of patients.

As per ACEP 2022 guidelines:

- Do not rely on current acute HF syndrome risk stratification tools alone to determine which patients may be discharged directly home from the emergency department. **[Evidence Level: D]**

- Consider using the Ottawa HF Risk Scale to help determine which higher-risk patients for adverse outcomes should not be discharged home. **[Evidence Level: C]**

- Consider using the Emergency HF Mortality Risk Grade for 7-day mortality or the STRATIFY decision tool to help determine which higher-risk patients for adverse outcomes should not be discharged home. **[Evidence Level: C]**

- Use shared decision-making strategies when determining the appropriate disposition of acute HF syndrome patients. **[Evidence Level: B]**
