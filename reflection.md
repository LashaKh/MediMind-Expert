## Implementation Process Review

### Phase-by-Phase Success
1. **Phase 1 (Lines 1-300):** Foundation setup with background, clinical findings, and initial guidelines
2. **Phase 2 (Lines 301-600):** Core guidelines and diagnostic investigations implementation
3. **Phase 3 (Lines 601-850):** Advanced management including surgical and device interventions
4. **Phase 4 (Lines 851-1070):** Special circumstances, references, and final integration

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Duplicate Content Sections
**Problem:** "Special Circumstances" section appeared twice in the UI with mixed content from different subsections
**Root Cause:** Content existed in both `guidelines.ts` and `specialCircumstances.ts` files
**Solution:** Removed duplicate section from `guidelines.ts`, kept comprehensive subsection structure in `specialCircumstances.ts`
**Lesson Learned:** Always verify section uniqueness across all component files

### Challenge 2: Import/Export Naming Conflicts
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation errors due to generic naming patterns
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent naming conventions across component exports
**Solution:** Implemented disease-specific prefixes (e.g., `hypertrophicCardiomyopathyGuidelines`)
**Lesson Learned:** Use specific, consistent naming conventions from the start

### Challenge 3: Styling Inconsistencies
**Problem:** Landmark trials showing incorrect styling (green instead of amber)
**Root Cause:** Content detection patterns not properly identifying landmark trials vs updated evidence
**Solution:** Verified proper content statement formatting and detection logic
**Lesson Learned:** Ensure content follows exact formatting patterns for proper UI styling

### Challenge 4: Reference Interface Compliance
**Problem:** TypeScript errors with reference objects containing unsupported fields
**Root Cause:** Reference interface didn't support volume, pages, pmid fields
**Solution:** Removed unsupported fields, kept essential reference information
**Lesson Learned:** Always verify interface compliance before implementation
