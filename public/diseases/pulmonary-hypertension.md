- **Evidence Level: B** - Provide female patients of childbearing potential with PAH with clear contraceptive advice, taking into account the individual needs of the patients, but recognizing that the implications of contraceptive failure are significant in PAH.
- **Evidence Level: B** - Provide prompt counseling in experienced PH centers to female patients with PAH considering pregnancy or becoming pregnant, in order to facilitate genetic counseling and shared decision-making and to provide psychological support to the patients and their families where needed.
- **Evidence Level: C** - Consider offering adoption and surrogacy with preconception genetic counseling in female patients with PAH desiring to have children.

**As per ACCP 2019 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: D** - Consider avoiding pregnancy in patients with PAH.

### Preventative Measures

#### Routine Immunizations
**As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: B** - Provide immunization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, influenza, and S. pneumoniae in patients with PAH.

**As per ACCP 2019 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: E** - Consider immunizing patients with PAH against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia.

## Follow-up and Surveillance

### Indications for Specialist Referral
**As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: B** - Refer symptomatic patients with mismatched perfusion lung defects beyond 3 months of anticoagulation or acute PE to a PH/CTEPH center, after considering the results of echocardiography, BNP/NT-proBNP, and/or cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
- **Evidence Level: B** - Refer patients with lung disease and suspected severe PH, or where there is uncertainty regarding the treatment of PH, to a PH center.
- **Evidence Level: B** - Refer patients with left heart disease and suspected PH with features of a severe pre-capillary component and/or markers of RV dysfunction to a PH center for complete diagnostic workup.
- **Evidence Level: B** - Refer patients with PAH associated with portal hypertension to centers with expertise in managing both conditions.

**As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: B** - Refer all patients with suspected CTEPH to a local expert PH center for the establishment of a formal diagnosis of CTEPH and assessment for the most appropriate treatment.
- **Evidence Level: B** - Consider referring patients with moderate-to-severe, lung disease-associated PH (with or without features of RV failure) to a PH center.

**As per ACCP 2019 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: E** - Consider referring all patients with PAH for evaluation at a center with expertise in the diagnosis of PAH, ideally before initiating therapy.

### Clinical and Imaging Follow-up
**As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: B** - Obtain regular reassessment using a panel of measures (clinical, functional, hemodynamic, and/or right ventricle size/function) in all patients with PAH.

**As per ERS/ESC 2016 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: B** - Follow-up stable patients every 3-6 months.

### Management of Persistent/Recurrent PH
**As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: C** - Consider offering a multimodality approach in patients with persistent PH after pulmonary endarterectomy.
- **Evidence Level: B** - Initiate riociguat in symptomatic patients with persistent or recurrent PH after pulmonary endarterectomy.
- **Evidence Level: C** - Consider initiating treprostinil SC in patients with persistent or recurrent PH after pulmonary endarterectomy.

**As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: B** - Initiate riociguat monotherapy in all patients with residual/recurrent CTEPH post-pulmonary endarterectomy.
- **Evidence Level: B** - Refer patients with PH (especially PAH and CTEPH) with persistent severe PH (NYHA functional class III or IV, and/or RV failure) despite maximal medical therapy for lung transplantation assessment.

## Quality Improvement

### Hospital Requirements
**As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:**
- **Evidence Level: B** - Ensure that PH centers:
  - Provide care by a multidisciplinary team including a cardiologist, pneumologist, rheumatologist, nurse specialist, radiologist, psychological and social work support, and appropriate on-call expertise
  - Have direct links and quick referral patterns to other services, such as genetic counseling, pulmonary endarterectomy/balloon pulmonary angioplasty, lung transplantation, and adult congenital heart disease service
  - Maintain a patient registry
  - Collaborate with patient associations
  - Follow-up a sufficient number of patients of at least 50 patients with PAH or CTEPH and at least 2 new referrals per month with documented PAH or CTEPH in order to maintain expertise, and consider establishing collaborations with high-volume centers
- **Evidence Level: C** - Consider ensuring that PH centers have accreditation and participate in collaborative clinical research.
