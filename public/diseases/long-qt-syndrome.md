- Consider diagnosing long QT syndrome in the presence of a QTc ≥ 460 ms and < 480 ms in repeated 12-lead ECGs in patients with an arrhythmic syncope, in the absence of secondary causes for QT prolongation. **[Evidence Level C]**
- Diagnose long QT syndrome in the presence of a pathogenic mutation irrespective of the QT duration. **[Evidence Level B]**

**As per APHRS/EHRA/HRS 2013 guidelines:**
- Diagnose long QT syndrome in the presence of the following:
  - Long QT syndrome risk score ≥ 3.5 in the absence of a secondary cause for QT prolongation and/or
  - Unequivocally pathogenic mutation in one of the long QT syndrome genes or
  - QT interval corrected for HR using Bazett's formula (QTc) ≥ 500 ms in repeated 12-lead ECG and in the absence of a secondary cause for QT prolongation **[Evidence Level B]**
