## Definition

Heart failure (HF) is "a clinical syndrome that results from structural or functional impairment of filling or ejection of blood from the heart."

### Classification by Ejection Fraction
- **HFrEF (Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction)**: ≤ 40%
- **HFpEF (Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction)**: ≥ 50%
- **HFmrEF (Heart Failure with Mid-Range Ejection Fraction)**: 41-50%

## Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: 219.3 cases per 100,000 person-years
- **Prevalence**: 1,915 persons per 100,000 population

## Causes

The most common causes of heart failure include:
1. Ischemic heart disease
2. Hypertensive heart disease
3. Valvular and rheumatic heart disease
4. Genetic cardiomyopathies
5. Congenital heart disease

## Clinical Manifestations

### 1. Pulmonary Symptoms
- Dyspnea
- Orthopnea
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea

### 2. Peripheral Symptoms
- Ankle swelling
- Abdominal bloating

### 3. Inflammatory Pathway Activation
- Early satiety
- Cachexia

### 4. Severe HF Manifestations
- Mild fatigue
- Exertional intolerance
- Cardiogenic shock

## Prognosis

- **1-year mortality**: 20.2%
- **5-year mortality**: 56.2%
- Over 50% of deaths are due to non-cardiovascular events

## Diagnostic Investigations

1. Clinical evaluation
2. Laboratory tests
3. ECG
4. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
5. Natriuretic peptide biomarkers
6. Chest radiography
7. Echocardiography (TTE)
8. Advanced cardiac imaging
9. Lung ultrasound
10. Psychosocial assessment

## Key Management Principles

### Risk Stratification
- Use validated multivariable risk scores
- Estimate incident HF risk and mortality

### Treatment Guidelines
1. Provide multidisciplinary care
2. Implement guideline-directed medical therapy
3. Address self-care barriers
4. Reduce re-hospitalization risk
5. Improve survival

### Pharmacologic Management
- Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
- Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
- Beta-blockers
- Diuretics
- SGLT-2 inhibitors

### Nonpharmacologic Interventions
- Optimize medication regimens
- Address lifestyle factors
- Consider device therapy where appropriate
